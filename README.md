# SVG in Open Type Tools for Python

The `svginot-builder` tool generates TrueType Font files using OpenType in SVG to
display full-color vector glyphs in supported systems.

[OpenType in SVG](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/svg.htm) was adopted by
the W3C on Jan 27th 2016 as part of Open Font Format and OpenType specifications.


NOTE: Firefox requires restart to reload an updated font.
